## Summary of Findings

The purpose of this report is to utilize cross-sectional forecasting models to evaluate different firms annual earnings; comparing the predicted earnings with analysts’ forecasts in order to assess predictive capability. The Fundamentals Annual dataset from Compustat and Guidance dataset from IBES were used, both sourced from WRDS , to gather the necessary financial information and analyst forecasts, in order to generate the required variables. n/
There are four different earnings forecasting models that were evaluated: HVZ, Random Walk, Earnings Persistence & Residual Income. Those models were developed using guidance from (Li & Mohanram, 2014) , as well as in-class explanations. Further that, the best model, which was found to be HVZ, was chosen and modified in order to potentially provide improvements; via manipulation of other predictor variables. Upon developing the optimal earnings forecasting model, it was then applied to 10 different firms stocks in order to predict Earnings per Share (EPS) and evaluated against analysts’ forecasts. Finally, the improved HVZ model was then applied to various industries in order to evaluate the top 10 firms in terms of earnings for the year 2019.
